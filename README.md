# tigol #

by Moritz Hilscher

tigol is a simple Game of Life simulation written in C for the Texas
Instruments graphic calculators. The project is free software and available
under the GPL license.

You can start it with `tigol()` and you can pass as argument the size of the
cells in pixels.

Here are some keyboard keys to control the game:

* p: Pause/continue the game
* r: Generate random cells
* Enter: Generate next generation if paused
* Esc: Exit the game
